abstract = {Artificial neural networks in Neurosciences. This article shows that artificial neural networks are used for confirming the relationships between physiological and cognitive changes. Specifically, we explore the influence of a decrease of neurotransmitters on the behaviour of old people in recognition tasks. This artificial neural network recognizes learned patterns. When we change the threshold of activation in some units, the artificial neural network simulates the experimental results of old people in recognition tasks. However, the main contributions of this paper are the design of an artificial neural network and its operation inspired by the nervous system and the way the inputs are coded and the process of orthogonalization of patterns.},

Semantic similarity is estimated by subjective ratings; contextual similarity is estimated by the method of sorting sentential contexts. The results show an inverse linear relationship between similarity of meaning and the discriminability of contexts. This relation, is obtained for two separate corpora of sentence contexts. It is concluded that, on average, for words in the same language drawn from the same syntactic and semantic categories, the more often two words can be substituted into the same contexts the more similar in meaning they are judged to be.},

abstract = {The malate dehydrogenase (MDH) electrophoretic mobilities of 128 strains of bacteroides belonging to 17 species, including three subspecies of Bacteroides melaninogenicus and two subspecies of Bacteroides ruminicola, were examined. Amongst the pigmented bacteroides, the migration of this enzyme correlated well with recognized taxa, and only one strain, VPI 9085 was clearly different. Other species such as B. oralis, B. buccalis, B. denticola, B. pentosaceus, B. bivius, B. disiens and B. ruminicola were delineated by the combined use of MDH and glutamate dehydrogenase. Forty-three strains belonging to the 'B. fragilis group' differed from the above species in possessing glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, and reference strains as well as fresh isolates were assigned to the correct species by the mobility pattern of these two enzymes. Other properties of MDH such as the pH optima for the oxidation of malate or the reduction of oxaloacetate were of limited taxonomic value. However, the alkaline stability of this enzyme at pH 9, 10 and 11 clearly differentiates the saccharolytic from the non-saccharolytic species of pigmented bacteroides with the latter showing highly stable enzymes with a half life greater than 50 min.},

Inference rules are extremely important in many fields such as natural language processing, information retrieval, and artificial intelligence in general. Our algorithm is based on an extended version of Harris' Distributional Hypothesis, which states that words that occurred in the same contexts tend to be similar. Instead of using this hypothesis on words, we apply it to paths in the dependency trees of a parsed corpus.},

The user composes mathematical expressions in a high-level description that mimics NumPy’s syntax and semantics, while being statically typed and functional (as opposed to imperative). These expressions allow Theano to provide symbolic differentiation. Before performing computation, Theano optimizes the choice of expressions, translates them into C++ (or CUDA for GPU), compiles them into dynamically loaded Python modules, all automatically. Common machine learning algorithms implemented with Theano are from 1:6 to 7:5 faster than competitive alternatives (including those implemented with C/C++, NumPy/SciPy and MATLAB) when compiled for the CPU and between 6:5 and 44 faster when compiled for the GPU. This paper illustrates how to use Theano, outlines the scope of the compiler, provides benchmarks on both CPU and GPU processors, and explains its overall design},

abstract = {Graph-based similarity over WordNet has been previously shown to perform very well on word similarity. This paper presents a study of the performance of such a graph-based algorithm when using different relations and versions of Wordnet. The graph algorithm is based on Personalized PageRank, a random-walk based algorithm which computes the probability of a random-walk initiated in the target word to reach any synset following the relations in WordNet (Haveliwala, 2002). Similarity is computed as the cosine of the probability distributions for each word over WordNet. The best combination of relations includes all relations in WordNet 3.0, included disambiguated glosses, and automatically disambiguated topic signatures called KnowNets. All relations are part of the official release of WordNet, except KnowNets, which have been derived automatically. The results over the WordSim 353 dataset show that using the adequate relations the performance improves over previously published WordNet-based results on the WordSim353 dataset (Finkelstein et al., 2002). The similarity software and some graphs used in this paper are publicly available at http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/ukb.},

Most research based on syntactically conditioned co-occurrences simply ignores the sali- ence of grammatical relations and effec- tively merges syntactic dependencies into one ‘context’. Through calculating distri- butional similarity, we design two experiments to explore and evaluate the four major types of contexts that are con- ditioned on grammatical relations. The consistent results show that the head-modifier dependency plays an important role in predicting the semantic features of nouns and verbs, in contrast to other dependencies.},

abstract = {Textual Entailment (TE) has been proposed as a generic framework for modeling language variability. The great potential of integrating (monolingual) TE recognition components into NLP architectures has been reported in several areas, such as question answering, information retrieval, information extraction and document summarization. Mainly due to the absence of cross-lingual TE (CLTE) recognition components, similar improvements have not yet been achieved in any corresponding cross-lingual application.
In this thesis, we propose and investigate Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment (CLTE) as a semantic relation between two text portions in dierent languages. We present dierent practical solutions to approach this problem
by i) bringing CLTE back to the monolingual scenario, translating the two texts into the same language; and ii) integrating machine translation and TE algorithms and techniques. We argue that CLTE can be a core tech-
nology for several cross-lingual NLP applications and tasks. Experiments on dierent datasets and two interesting cross-lingual NLP applications, namely content synchronization and machine translation evaluation, conrm the eectiveness of our approaches leading to successful results. As a complement to the research in the algorithmic side, we successfully explored the creation of cross-lingual textual entailment corpora by means of
crowdsourcing, as a cheap and replicable data collection methodology that minimizes the manual work done by expert annotators.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT In this article, we present a comprehensive study aimed at computing semantic relatedness of word pairs. We analyze the performance of a large number of semantic relatedness measures proposed in the literature with respect to different experimental conditions, such as (i) the datasets employed, (ii) the language (English or German), (iii) the underlying knowledge source, and (iv) the evaluation task (computing scores of semantic relatedness, ranking word pairs, solving word choice problems). To our knowledge, this study is the first to systematically analyze semantic relatedness on a large number of datasets with different properties, while emphasizing the role of the knowledge source compiled either by the (i.e., classical wordnets) or by the (i.e., collaboratively constructed knowledge sources like Wikipedia).The article discusses benefits and drawbacks of different approaches to evaluating semantic relatedness. We show that results should be interpreted carefully to evaluate particular aspects of semantic relatedness. For the first time, we employ a vector based measure of semantic relatedness, relying on a concept space built from documents, to the first paragraph of Wikipedia articles, to English WordNet glosses, and to GermaNet based pseudo glosses. Contrary to previous research (Strube and Ponzetto 2006; Gabrilovich and Markovitch 2007; Zesch et al. 2007), we find that based resources are not superior to based resources. We also find that using the first paragraph of a Wikipedia article as opposed to the whole article leads to better precision, but decreases recall. Finally, we present two systems that were developed to aid the experiments presented herein and are freely available for research purposes: (i) DEXTRACT, a software to semi-automatically construct corpus-driven semantic relatedness datasets, and (ii) JWPL, a Java-based high-performance Wikipedia Application Programming Interface (API) for building natural language processing (NLP) applications.},

abstract = {Semantic relatedness is a special form of linguistic distance between words. Eval- uating semantic relatedness measures is usually performed by comparison with hu- man judgments. Previous test datasets had been created analytically and were limited in size. We propose a corpus-based system for automatically creating test datasets.1 Experiments with human subjects show that the resulting datasets cover all de- grees of relatedness. As a result of the corpus-based approach, test datasets cover all types of lexical-semantic relations and contain domain-specific words naturally occurring in texts.},

abstract = {User-generated discourse from Web 2.0 poses particular challenges to natural language processing (NLP) due to its noise and error proneness. A data cleansing step preceding the analysis steps in an NLP pipeline can reduce the problems. While recent efforts provide general-purpose collections of UIMA-based analysis components, data cleansing seems not yet to be covered. The five-stage data cleansing approach proposed here offers a maximum of flexibility in identifying problematic artifacts, deciding how to deal with them and analysing cleansed data. Simultaneously, it allowed us to create reusable UIMA-based components for the actual data cleansing and for mapping annotations created on the clean data back to the original representation. These components are released as part of the Darmstadt Knowledge Processing Software Repository (DKPro) under the name of DKPro-UGD.},

For the rst time, we ap- ply a concept vector based measure to a set of different con- cept representations like Wiktionary pseudo glosses, the rst paragraph of Wikipedia articles, English WordNet glosses, and GermaNet pseudo glosses. We show that: (i) Wiktionary is the best lexical semantic resource in the ranking task and performs comparably to other resources in the word choice task, and (ii) the concept vector based approach yields the best results on all datasets in both evaluations.},

The involves context-guided semantic keyword extraction and clustering information retrieval process to automatically generate new, augmented queries. The latter are submitted to a host of general and domain-specific search engines. The results are then semantically reranked, again, using context. It is our belief that letting context guide the search provides a better match to the user’s current needs than just relying on the user’s fixed personal profile. Our guide search effectively offers even inexperienced users an advanced search tool on the Web},

abstract = {Networks have in recent years emerged as an invaluable tool for describing and quantifying complex systems in many branches of science. Recent studies suggest that networks often exhibit hierarchical organization, in which vertices divide into groups that further subdivide into groups of groups, and so forth over multiple scales. In many cases the groups are found to correspond to known functional units, such as ecological niches in food webs, modules in biochemical networks (protein interaction networks, metabolic networks or genetic regulatory networks) or communities in social networks. Here we present a general technique for inferring hierarchical structure from network data and show that the existence of hierarchy can simultaneously explain and quantitatively reproduce many commonly observed topological properties of networks, such as right-skewed degree distributions, high clustering coefficients and short path lengths. We further show that knowledge of hierarchical structure can be used to predict missing connections in partly known networks with high accuracy, and for more general network structures than competing techniques. Taken together, our results suggest that hierarchy is a central organizing principle of complex networks, capable of offering insight into many network phenomena.},

abstract = {A novel text classification approach is proposed in this paper based on deep belief network. Deep belief network constructs a deep architecture to obtain the high level abstraction of input data, which can be used to model the semantic correlation among words of documents. After basic features are selected by statistical feature selection measures, a deep belief network with discriminative fine tuning strategy is built on basic features to learn high level deep features. A support vector machine is then trained on the learned deep features. The proposed method outperforms traditional classifier based on support vector machine. As a dimension reduction strategy, the deep belief network also outperforms the traditional latent semantic indexing method. Detailed experiments are also made to show the effect of different fine tuning strategies and network structures on the performance of deep belief network.},

abstract = {We show how to learn a deep graphical model of the word-count vectors obtained from a large set of documents. The values of the latent variables in the deepest layer are easy to infer and give a much better representation of each document than Latent Semantic Analysis. When the deepest layer is forced to use a small number of ¿¾ binary variables (e.g. ), the graphical model performs ” semantic hashing”: Documents are mapped to memory addresses in such a way that semantically similar documents are located at nearby ad- dresses. Documents similar to a query document can then be found by simply accessing all the addresses that differ by only a few bits from the address of the query document. This way of extending the efﬁciency of hash-coding to approximate matching is much faster than locality sensitive hashing, which is the fastest current method. By using semantic hashing to ﬁlter the documents given to TF-IDF, we achieve higher accuracy than applying TF-IDF to the entire doc- ument set.},

Discovering this recursive structure helps us to not only identify the units that an image or sentence contains but also how they interact to form a whole. We introduce a max-margin structure prediction architecture based on re- cursive neural networks that can successfully recover such structure both in complex scene images as well as sentences. The same algo- rithm can be used both to provide a competi- tive syntactic parser for natural language sen- tences from the Penn Treebank and to out- perform alternative approaches for semantic scene segmentation, annotation and classifi- cation. For segmentation and annotation our algorithm obtains a new level of state-of-the- art performance on the Stanford background dataset (78.1\%). The features from the im- age parse tree outperform Gist descriptors for scene classification by 4\%.},

@article{Blei2010,
abstract = {In this article, we review probabilistic topic models: graphical models that can be used to summarize a large collection of documents with a smaller number of distributions over words. Those distributions are called "topics" because, when fit to data, they capture the salient themes that run through the collection. We describe both finite-dimensional parametric topic models and their Bayesian nonparametric counterparts, which are based on the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP). We discuss two extensions of topic models to time-series data-one that lets the topics slowly change over time and one that lets the assumed prevalence of the topics change. Finally, we illustrate the application of topic models to nontext data, summarizing some recent research results in image analysis.},

A machine learning algorithm based on KCCA is studied for cross-language information retrieval. We apply the algorithm in Japanese–English cross-language information retrieval. The results are quite encouraging and are significantly better than those obtained by other state of the art methods. Computational complexity is an important issue when applying KCCA to large dataset as in information retrieval. We experimentally evaluate several methods to alleviate the problem of applying KCCA to large datasets. We also investigate cross-language document classification using KCCA as well as other methods. Our results show that it is feasible to use a classifier learned in one language to classify the documents in other languages.},

abstract = {Recently, many applications for Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) have been developed for a large variety of learning problems. However, RBMs are usually used as feature extractors for another learning algorithm or to provide a good initialization for deep feed-forward neural network classiﬁers, and are not considered as a standalone solution to classiﬁcation problems. In this paper, we argue that RBMs provide a self-contained framework for deriving competitive non-linear classiﬁers. We present an evaluation of diﬀerent learning algorithms for RBMs which aim at introducing a discriminative component to RBM training and improve their performance as classiﬁers. This approach is simple in that RBMs are used directly to build a classiﬁer, rather than as a stepping stone. Finally, we demonstrate how discriminative RBMs can also be successfully employed in a semi-supervised setting.},

Deep architectures are composed of multiple levels of non-linear operations, such as in neural nets with many hidden layers or in complicated propositional formulae re-using many sub-formulae. Searching the parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult task, but learning algorithms such as those for Deep Belief Networks have recently been proposed to tackle this problem with notable success, beating the state-of-the-art in certain areas. This paper discusses the motivations and principles regarding learning algorithms for deep architectures, in particular those exploiting as building blocks unsupervised learning of single-layer models such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines, used to construct deeper models such as Deep Belief Networks.},

abstract = {Computers understand very little of the meaning of human language. This profoundly limits our ability to give instructions to computers, the ability of computers to explain their actions to us, and the ability of computers to analyse and process text. Vector space models (VSMs) of semantics are beginning to address these limits. This paper surveys the use of VSMs for semantic processing of text. We organize the literature on VSMs according to the structure of the matrix in a VSM. There are currently three broad classes of VSMs, based on term-document, word-context, and pair-pattern matrices, yielding three classes of applications. We survey a broad range of applications in these three categories and we take a detailed look at a specific open source project in each category. Our goal in this survey is to show the breadth of applications of VSMs for semantics, to provide a new perspective on VSMs for those who are already familiar with the area, and to provide pointers into the literature for those who are less familiar with the field.},

abstract = {We show how to use “complementary priors” to eliminate the explaining away effects that make inference difficult in densely-connected belief nets that have many hidden layers. Using com- plementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that finetunes the weights us- ing a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit im- ages and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modelled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory and it is easy to ex- plore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind.},

In this paper, our goal is to develop efficient image search and scene matching techniques that are not only fast, but also require very little memory, enabling their use on standard hardware or even on handheld devices. Our approach uses recently developed machine learning tech- niques to convert the Gist descriptor (a real valued vector that describes orientation energies at different scales and orientations within an image) to a compact binary code, with a few hundred bits per image. Using our scheme, it is possible to perform real-time searches with millions from the Internet using a single large PC and obtain recognition results comparable to the full descriptor. Using our codes on high quality labeled images from the LabelMe database gives surprisingly powerful recognition results using simple nearest neighbor techniques.},

In this work, we propose a novel application of deep networks to learn features over multiple modalities. We present a series of tasks for multimodal learning and show how to train deep networks that learn features to address these tasks. In particular, we demonstrate cross modality feature learning, where better features for one modality (e.g., video) can be learned if multiple modalities (e.g., audio and video) are present at feature learning time. Furthermore, we show how to learn a shared representation between modalities and evalu- ate it on a unique task, where the classifier is trained with audio-only data but tested with video-only data and vice-versa. Our mod- els are validated on the CUAVE and AVLet- ters datasets on audio-visual speech classifi- cation, demonstrating best published visual speech classification on AVLetters and effec- tive shared representation learning.},

@inproceedings{Tzortzis2007,
abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach for spam filtering based on the use of Deep Belief Networks (DBNs). In contrast to conventional feedfoward neural networks having one or two hidden layers, DBNs are feedforward neural networks with many hidden layers. Until recently it was not clear how to initialize the weights of deep neural networks, which resulted in poor solutions with low generalization capabilities. A greedy layer-wise unsupervised algorithm was recently proposed to tackle this problem with successful results. In this work we present a methodology for spam detection based on DBNs and evaluate its performance on three widely used datasets. We also compare our method to Support Vector Machines (SVMs) which is the state-of-the-art method for spam filtering in terms of classification performance. Our experiments indicate that using DBNs to filter spam e-mails is a viable methodology, since they achieve similar or even better performance than SVMs on all three datasets.},

@article{Li2007,
abstract = {We study several machine learning algorithms for cross-language patent retrieval and classification. In comparison with most of other studies involving machine learning for cross-language information retrieval, which basically used learning techniques for monolingual sub-tasks, our learning algorithms exploit the bilingual training documents and learn a semantic representation from them. We study Japanese-English cross-language patent retrieval using Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (KCCA), a method of correlating linear relationships between two variables in kernel defined feature spaces. The results are quite encouraging and are significantly better than those obtained by other state of the art methods. We also investigate learning algorithms for cross-language document classification. The learning algorithm are based on KCCA and Support Vector Machines (SVM). In particular, we study two ways of combining the KCCA and SVM and found that one particular combination called SVM2k achieved better results than other learning algorithms for either bilingual or monolingual test documents.},

@inproceedings{min2009deep,
abstract = {KNN is one of the most popular data mining methods for classiﬁcation, but it often fails to work well with inappropriate choice of distance metric or due to the presence of numerous class-irrelevant features. Linear feature transformation methods have been widely applied to extract classrelevant information to improve kNN classiﬁcation, which is very limited in many applications. Kernels have also been used to learn powerful non-linear feature transformations, but these methods fail to scale to large datasets. In this paper, we present a scalable non-linear feature mapping method based on a deep neural network pretrained with Restricted Boltzmann Machines for improving kNN classi- ﬁcation in a large-margin framework, which we call DNetkNN. DNet-kNN can be used for both classiﬁcation and for supervised dimensionality reduction. The experimental results on two benchmark handwritten digit datasets and one newsgroup text dataset show that DNet-kNN has much better performance than large-margin kNN using a linear mapping and kNN based on a deep autoencoder pretrained with Restricted Boltzmann Machines.},
