Inference rules are extremely important in many fields such as natural language processing, information retrieval, and artificial intelligence in general. Our algorithm is based on an extended version of Harris' Distributional Hypothesis, which states that words that occurred in the same contexts tend to be similar. Instead of using this hypothesis on words, we apply it to paths in the dependency trees of a parsed corpus.},

abstract = {The malate dehydrogenase (MDH) electrophoretic mobilities of 128 strains of bacteroides belonging to 17 species, including three subspecies of Bacteroides melaninogenicus and two subspecies of Bacteroides ruminicola, were examined. Amongst the pigmented bacteroides, the migration of this enzyme correlated well with recognized taxa, and only one strain, VPI 9085 was clearly different. Other species such as B. oralis, B. buccalis, B. denticola, B. pentosaceus, B. bivius, B. disiens and B. ruminicola were delineated by the combined use of MDH and glutamate dehydrogenase. Forty-three strains belonging to the 'B. fragilis group' differed from the above species in possessing glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, and reference strains as well as fresh isolates were assigned to the correct species by the mobility pattern of these two enzymes. Other properties of MDH such as the pH optima for the oxidation of malate or the reduction of oxaloacetate were of limited taxonomic value. However, the alkaline stability of this enzyme at pH 9, 10 and 11 clearly differentiates the saccharolytic from the non-saccharolytic species of pigmented bacteroides with the latter showing highly stable enzymes with a half life greater than 50 min.},

@misc{Mehdad2012,
abstract = {Textual Entailment (TE) has been proposed as a generic framework for modeling language variability. The great potential of integrating (monolingual) TE recognition components into NLP architectures has been reported in several areas, such as question answering, information retrieval, information extraction and document summarization. Mainly due to the absence of cross-lingual TE (CLTE) recognition components, similar improvements have not yet been achieved in any corresponding cross-lingual application.
In this thesis, we propose and investigate Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment (CLTE) as a semantic relation between two text portions in dierent languages. We present dierent practical solutions to approach this problem
by i) bringing CLTE back to the monolingual scenario, translating the two texts into the same language; and ii) integrating machine translation and TE algorithms and techniques. We argue that CLTE can be a core tech-
nology for several cross-lingual NLP applications and tasks. Experiments on dierent datasets and two interesting cross-lingual NLP applications, namely content synchronization and machine translation evaluation, conrm the eectiveness of our approaches leading to successful results. As a complement to the research in the algorithmic side, we successfully explored the creation of cross-lingual textual entailment corpora by means of
crowdsourcing, as a cheap and replicable data collection methodology that minimizes the manual work done by expert annotators.},

@article{Clauset2008,
abstract = {Networks have in recent years emerged as an invaluable tool for describing and quantifying complex systems in many branches of science. Recent studies suggest that networks often exhibit hierarchical organization, in which vertices divide into groups that further subdivide into groups of groups, and so forth over multiple scales. In many cases the groups are found to correspond to known functional units, such as ecological niches in food webs, modules in biochemical networks (protein interaction networks, metabolic networks or genetic regulatory networks) or communities in social networks. Here we present a general technique for inferring hierarchical structure from network data and show that the existence of hierarchy can simultaneously explain and quantitatively reproduce many commonly observed topological properties of networks, such as right-skewed degree distributions, high clustering coefficients and short path lengths. We further show that knowledge of hierarchical structure can be used to predict missing connections in partly known networks with high accuracy, and for more general network structures than competing techniques. Taken together, our results suggest that hierarchy is a central organizing principle of complex networks, capable of offering insight into many network phenomena.},

In this work, we extend the RESCAL tensor factorization, which has shown state-of-the-art results for multi-relational learning, to account for the binary nature of adjacency tensors. We study the improvements that can be gained via this approach on various benchmark datasets and show that the logistic extension can improve the prediction results significantly.},

abstract = {We propose a unified neural network architecture and learning algorithm that can be applied to various natural language processing tasks including: part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition, and semantic role labeling. This versatility is achieved by trying to avoid task-specific engineering and therefore disregarding a lot of prior knowledge. Instead of exploiting man-made input features carefully optimized for each task, our system learns internal representations on the basis of vast amounts of mostly unlabeled training data. This work is then used as a basis for building a freely available tagging system with good performance and minimal computational requirements.},

	and Domingos, 2009)
        
	SRL: Semantic Role Labeling, predicting semantic structure
        
	Lemma vs. synset : lemma is allowed to be semantically ambigous
        
        
        
Goal
	produce MRs of the following form: relation(subject, object)
        
	each component of the resulting triplet refers to 		a disambiguated entity (e.g. sense dismabiguation)
        
Resources
        
	WordNet \& ConceptNet : no link of knowledge to raw text  	 Wikipedia : raw text which entities are not grounded (?)
	Unambiguous Wikipedia
	Extended WordNet
        
Method
        
	1. SRL (exisitng model:SENNA)
	2. Disambiguation: lemmas must be converted into synset 			   (energy learning)
        
Step 2
        
	jointly capture semantic information between words, entities 		and combinations of those
        
	assign low energy values to plausible combinations(what 	combination?)
        
	2.1) learn "embedding" for each symbol(low dimensional vector)
	2.2)  Minimize "Semantic Matching Energy Function"
        
Multi-Task Learning
        
	MRs induced from text and relations between
	entities are embedded (and integrated) in the same
	space.
        
	--> learn to perform disambiguation on raw text (Wikipedia) by 		    using large amounts of indirect supervision and little 		    direct supervision.

Evaluation:
        
        
Questions
        
	We only consider sentences that match the following
	template: (subject, verb, direct object). (why ?)
        
	each of the three elements of the template is associated with a
	tuple of lemmatized words (i.e. a multi-word phrase).( what 		are these associated tuples)},

abstract = {Recursive structure is commonly found in the inputs of different modalities such as natural scene images or natural language sentences. Discovering this recursive structure helps us to not only identify the units that an image or sentence contains but also how they interact to form a whole. We introduce a max-margin structure prediction architecture based on re- cursive neural networks that can successfully recover such structure both in complex scene images as well as sentences. The same algo- rithm can be used both to provide a competi- tive syntactic parser for natural language sen- tences from the Penn Treebank and to out- perform alternative approaches for semantic scene segmentation, annotation and classifi- cation. For segmentation and annotation our algorithm obtains a new level of state-of-the- art performance on the Stanford background dataset (78.1\%). The features from the im- age parse tree outperform Gist descriptors for scene classification by 4\%.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach for spam filtering based on the use of Deep Belief Networks (DBNs). In contrast to conventional feedfoward neural networks having one or two hidden layers, DBNs are feedforward neural networks with many hidden layers. Until recently it was not clear how to initialize the weights of deep neural networks, which resulted in poor solutions with low generalization capabilities. A greedy layer-wise unsupervised algorithm was recently proposed to tackle this problem with successful results. In this work we present a methodology for spam detection based on DBNs and evaluate its performance on three widely used datasets. We also compare our method to Support Vector Machines (SVMs) which is the state-of-the-art method for spam filtering in terms of classification performance. Our experiments indicate that using DBNs to filter spam e-mails is a viable methodology, since they achieve similar or even better performance than SVMs on all three datasets.},

These include object recognition [2], computer graphics [11, 27], personal photo collections, online image search tools. In this paper, our goal is to develop efficient image search and scene matching techniques that are not only fast, but also require very little memory, enabling their use on standard hardware or even on handheld devices. Our approach uses recently developed machine learning tech- niques to convert the Gist descriptor (a real valued vector that describes orientation energies at different scales and orientations within an image) to a compact binary code, with a few hundred bits per image. Using our scheme, it is possible to perform real-time searches with millions from the Internet using a single large PC and obtain recognition results comparable to the full descriptor. Using our codes on high quality labeled images from the LabelMe database gives surprisingly powerful recognition results using simple nearest neighbor techniques.},

abstract = {Theoretical results suggest that in order to learn the kind of complicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g. in vision, language, and other AI-level tasks), one may need insist deep architectures. Deep architectures are composed of multiple levels of non-linear operations, such as in neural nets with many hidden layers or in complicated propositional formulae re-using many sub-formulae. Searching the parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult task, but learning algorithms such as those for Deep Belief Networks have recently been proposed to tackle this problem with notable success, beating the state-of-the-art in certain areas. This paper discusses the motivations and principles regarding learning algorithms for deep architectures, in particular those exploiting as building blocks unsupervised learning of single-layer models such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines, used to construct deeper models such as Deep Belief Networks.},

We describe both finite-dimensional parametric topic models and their Bayesian nonparametric counterparts, which are based on the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP). We discuss two extensions of topic models to time-series data-one that lets the topics slowly change over time and one that lets the assumed prevalence of the topics change. Finally, we illustrate the application of topic models to nontext data, summarizing some recent research results in image analysis.},

Deep belief network constructs a deep architecture to obtain the high level abstraction of input data, which can be used to model the semantic correlation among words of documents. After basic features are selected by statistical feature selection measures, a deep belief network with discriminative fine tuning strategy is built on basic features to learn high level deep features. A support vector machine is then trained on the learned deep features. The proposed method outperforms traditional classifier based on support vector machine. As a dimension reduction strategy, the deep belief network also outperforms the traditional latent semantic indexing method. Detailed experiments are also made to show the effect of different fine tuning strategies and network structures on the performance of deep belief network.},

However, RBMs are usually used as feature extractors for another learning algorithm or to provide a good initialization for deep feed-forward neural network classiﬁers, and are not considered as a standalone solution to classiﬁcation problems. In this paper, we argue that RBMs provide a self-contained framework for deriving competitive non-linear classiﬁers. We present an evaluation of diﬀerent learning algorithms for RBMs which aim at introducing a discriminative component to RBM training and improve their performance as classiﬁers. This approach is simple in that RBMs are used directly to build a classiﬁer, rather than as a stepping stone. Finally, we demonstrate how discriminative RBMs can also be successfully employed in a semi-supervised setting.},

abstract = {KNN is one of the most popular data mining methods for classiﬁcation, but it often fails to work well with inappropriate choice of distance metric or due to the presence of numerous class-irrelevant features. Linear feature transformation methods have been widely applied to extract classrelevant information to improve kNN classiﬁcation, which is very limited in many applications. Kernels have also been used to learn powerful non-linear feature transformations, but these methods fail to scale to large datasets. In this paper, we present a scalable non-linear feature mapping method based on a deep neural network pretrained with Restricted Boltzmann Machines for improving kNN classi- ﬁcation in a large-margin framework, which we call DNetkNN. DNet-kNN can be used for both classiﬁcation and for supervised dimensionality reduction. The experimental results on two benchmark handwritten digit datasets and one newsgroup text dataset show that DNet-kNN has much better performance than large-margin kNN using a linear mapping and kNN based on a deep autoencoder pretrained with Restricted Boltzmann Machines.},

Gradient descent can be used for fine-tuning the weights in such "autoencoder" networks, but this works well only if the initial weights are close to a good solution. We describe an effective way of initializing the weights that allows deep autoencoder networks to learn low-dimensional codes that work much better than principal components analysis as a tool to reduce the dimensionality of data.},

In comparison with most of other studies involving machine learning for cross-language information retrieval, which basically used learning techniques for monolingual sub-tasks, our learning algorithms exploit the bilingual training documents and learn a semantic representation from them. We study Japanese-English cross-language patent retrieval using Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (KCCA), a method of correlating linear relationships between two variables in kernel defined feature spaces. The results are quite encouraging and are significantly better than those obtained by other state of the art methods. We also investigate learning algorithms for cross-language document classification. The learning algorithm are based on KCCA and Support Vector Machines (SVM). In particular, we study two ways of combining the KCCA and SVM and found that one particular combination called SVM2k achieved better results than other learning algorithms for either bilingual or monolingual test documents.},

abstract = {We show how to use “complementary priors” to eliminate the explaining away effects that make inference difficult in densely-connected belief nets that have many hidden layers. Using com- plementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that finetunes the weights us- ing a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit im- ages and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modelled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory and it is easy to ex- plore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind.},

abstract = {Deep networks have been successfully applied to unsupervised feature learning for single modalities (e.g., text, images or audio). In this work, we propose a novel application of deep networks to learn features over multiple modalities. We present a series of tasks for multimodal learning and show how to train deep networks that learn features to address these tasks. In particular, we demonstrate cross modality feature learning, where better features for one modality (e.g., video) can be learned if multiple modalities (e.g., audio and video) are present at feature learning time. Furthermore, we show how to learn a shared representation between modalities and evalu- ate it on a unique task, where the classifier is trained with audio-only data but tested with video-only data and vice-versa. Our mod- els are validated on the CUAVE and AVLet- ters datasets on audio-visual speech classifi- cation, demonstrating best published visual speech classification on AVLetters and effec- tive shared representation learning.},

abstract = {We show how to learn a deep graphical model of the word-count vectors obtained from a large set of documents. The values of the latent variables in the deepest layer are easy to infer and give a much better representation of each document than Latent Semantic Analysis. When the deepest layer is forced to use a small number of ¿¾ binary variables (e.g. ), the graphical model performs ” semantic hashing”: Documents are mapped to memory addresses in such a way that semantically similar documents are located at nearby ad- dresses. Documents similar to a query document can then be found by simply accessing all the addresses that differ by only a few bits from the address of the query document. This way of extending the efﬁciency of hash-coding to approximate matching is much faster than locality sensitive hashing, which is the fastest current method. By using semantic hashing to ﬁlter the documents given to TF-IDF, we achieve higher accuracy than applying TF-IDF to the entire doc- ument set.},

abstract = {We introduce a two-layer undirected graphical model, called a “Replicated Soft- max”, that can be used to model and automatically extract low-dimensional latent semantic representations from a large unstructured collection of documents. We present efficient learning and inference algorithms for this model, and show how a Monte-Carlo based method, Annealed Importance Sampling, can be used to pro- duce an accurate estimate of the log-probability the model assigns to test data. This allows us to demonstrate that the proposed model is able to generalize much better compared to Latent Dirichlet Allocation in terms of both the log-probability of held-out documents and the retrieval accuracy.},

@article{Turney2010,
abstract = {Computers understand very little of the meaning of human language. This profoundly limits our ability to give instructions to computers, the ability of computers to explain their actions to us, and the ability of computers to analyse and process text. Vector space models (VSMs) of semantics are beginning to address these limits. This paper surveys the use of VSMs for semantic processing of text. We organize the literature on VSMs according to the structure of the matrix in a VSM. There are currently three broad classes of VSMs, based on term-document, word-context, and pair-pattern matrices, yielding three classes of applications. We survey a broad range of applications in these three categories and we take a detailed look at a specific open source project in each category. Our goal in this survey is to show the breadth of applications of VSMs for semantics, to provide a new perspective on VSMs for those who are already familiar with the area, and to provide pointers into the literature for those who are less familiar with the field.},
